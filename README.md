## Introduction  
AI-Kavach is a cybersecurity project focused on detecting suspicious threats and alerting users in real-time. It leverages AI models, rule-based detection, and network analysis.  

## Features  
âœ… Anomaly detection using machine learning  
âœ… Real-time email alerts  
âœ… Flask web dashboard for threat monitoring  
âœ… SQLite database for logging incidents  

## Modeling and Evaluation  
- Used a combination of **machine learning (Random Forest, SVM)** and **rule-based detection**.  
- Evaluated using **precision, recall, and F1-score** metrics.  

## Future Scope  
ðŸš€ The project successfully identifies cyber threats in real-time.  
ðŸš€ Future improvements include **integrating real-world attack datasets** and deploying as a background service.
